So this one kicked my ass.  I ended it up solving it the dumbest way possible,
which works, because it's limited to angles that are multiples of 45 degrees.
In the more general case, I'd have to actually get the math to work.

lines.py and diagonallines.py are what I was going for. lines.py works, but
diagonallines.py doesn't. I ended up using dumb.py to solve part 2, and went
back and copied it over for part 1 as well.
